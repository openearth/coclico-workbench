There is for instance well known subsidence along the Italian Adriatic, the Netherlands or even in more localized shorelines such as the Aksiou delta next to Thessaloniki in Greece. This subsidence context can strongly inflate coastal hazards locally and should therefore be accounted for. The CoCliCo project explored local VLMs using the land vertical velocity estimates from the Copernicus European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) derived over the period 2016-2021 (\u200b\u200bThi\u00e9blemont et al., 2024). While these estimates are not implemented in the regional sea-level projections of CoCliCo, they have been considered for the coastal hazard assessment and can be explored as an exploratory tool using the Workbench.  </p> <p>The Extreme Surge Level (SSL) data layer provides projections of storm surge levels along the European coastline under different climate scenarios. Storm surges are a critical component of coastal hazards, and understanding how they may evolve in the future is essential for coastal risk assessment and adaptation planning.

The output of the model (efficient adaptation pathways in the middle of the Figure) then feed onto the CoCliCo platform. Several parts or even components of this detailed Figure can be excluded to simplify it, e.g. dynamic programming, implementation of adaptation options, etc. The SSP/RCP scenarios inform the sea level rise (SLR) and vertical land motion (VLM) data.</p> <p></p> <p>Methods</p> <p>The cost-benefit optimisation integrates several components:  </p> <ul> <li>A hazard component to model extreme sea level </li> <li>An exposure component to assess population and assets at risk </li> <li>A vulnerability component to assess the susceptibility of assets to hazards </li> <li>An adaptation state space to outline potential adaptation pathways </li> <li>Cost functions to estimate the costs associated with adaptation actions </li> </ul> <p>The multi-stage cost-benefit optimisation is conducted for each of the 41,327 coastal floodplains individually. We consider a time horizon from 2020 to 2150 with 10-year time steps, a discount rate of 3% and three greenhouse gas emission scenarios: low emissions (SSP1-2.6), high emissions (SSP2-4.5) and very high emissions (SSP5-8.5).  </p> <p>Climate Scenario</p> <p>The dataset includes projections for three climate scenarios:</p> <ul> <li> <p>SSP1-2.6 A low-emission scenario where global temperatures are limited to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, reflecting a sustainable future with rapid decarbonization.</p> </li> <li> <p>SSP2-4.5 A medium-emission scenario where global temperatures rise moderately, reflecting a future with some efforts to mitigate climate change.</p> </li> <li> <p>SSP5-8.5 A high-emission scenario where global temperatures rise significantly, reflecting a future with continued high greenhouse gas emissions and limited mitigation efforts.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Projections</p> <p>The dataset includes projections up to the years 2050, 2100, and 2150, offering key metrics to inform decision-making for coastal resilience.</p> <p>Adaptation Strategy</p> <ul> <li>Protection Raising coastal defenses.</li> <li>Retreat Managed withdrawal from vulnerable areas.</li> <li>Accommodation Implementing flood-proofing measures.</li> <li>Protection &amp; Retreat A combined strategy where both approaches are efficient.</li> <li>No Adaptation Areas where adaptation measures are deemed inefficient.</li> </ul> <p>The analysis accounts for adaptation costs, residual flood damages, and the most cost-efficient adaptation strategies for each floodplain.</p> <p>How to Use the Data</p> <ul> <li> Scenario Selection: Choose from the available scenarios ( RCP4.5, RCP8.5) to explore how Cost-Benefit Analysis may change under different climate futures.</li> <li> Adaptation Strategy: Select an adaptation strategy between Protection, Retreat, Accommodation, Protection &amp; Retreat adn No Adaptation</li> <li> Projection: Choose between 2050, 2100, or 2150, depending on the timeframe for the adaptation strategy.</li> </ul> <p>Model Outputs</p> <ul> <li> <p>For each coastal floodplain, the model determines the economically optimal adaptation pathway, which is a sequence of adaptation options over time. These adaptation pathways can be explored through the workbench. </p> </li> <li> <p>The web viewer illustrates the proportion of the coastline where each adaptation option is economically optimal by 2150 for each country, based on the economically optimal coastal adaptation pathways for all 41,327 floodplains. </p> </li> </ul> <p>Why Is This Data Important?</p> <p>This dataset is crucial for guiding cost-effective and sustainable coastal adaptation strategies under different climate change and socioeconomic scenarios. It helps:</p> <ul> <li> Coastal decision-makers initiate proactive adaptation planning.</li> <li> Global institutions estimate future adaptation costs at regional and national scales.</li> <li> Researchers and policymakers assess the effectiveness of adaptation pathways over time.</li> </ul> <p>Example of use</p> <p>\"National policymakers identified that significant funding would be required to address coastal flood risks in various regions. They allocated funding for coastal adaptation, encouraging local authorities to conduct their own research. This approach allowed local governments to assess specific risks and develop tailored solutions, ensuring more effective, region-specific adaptation strategies.\"</p> <p>Limitations</p> <p>This cost-benefit model uses broad data to manage computational limits, which means it doesn't include detailed information about properties, land use, or infrastructure. As a result, the model may be less accurate for specific floodplains. For example, it might suggest retreat as the best adaptation option for an area with a nuclear power plant, but this could present major challenges that the model doesn\u2019t account for. </p> <p>The model also only considers the median sea-level rise (SLR), leaving out high-end SLR scenarios. A sensitivity analysis showed that uncertainties in factors like the discount rate, protection and retreat costs, and protection levels have a bigger impact on the choice of adaptation options, the timing of actions, and total costs than the climate change scenarios themselves.  </p> <p>Further Analysis</p> <p>Technical users can use the Workbench to perform detailed, localized analyses by adjusting variables like flood risks, cost factors, and adaptation options. This allows for tailored assessments of the most cost-effective strategies and the timing of actions at the local scale. </p> <p>Users can explore different sea-level rise scenarios, test adaptation measures, and incorporate local data such as infrastructure details to refine their analysis.
