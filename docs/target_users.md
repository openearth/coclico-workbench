### **1. Policymakers & Regulatory Authorities**
*Policymakers and regulatory authorities are key players in implementing national and EU policies, such as the European Flood Risk Directive. They rely on the CoCliCo platform to assess coastal flood risks, map flood extents, and identify exposed assets and populations. This helps Member States comply with the Directive and develop effective risk reduction strategies.*

**Primary Use:**

- Use the platform to evaluate flood risks, generate hazard and risk maps, and assess climate change impacts. This supports the creation of flood management plans and ensures compliance with the European Flood Risk Directive.

**Example Case:**
>  *"Using the platform to visualize flood risk and support national-level strategies to meet the European Flood Risk Directive."*

---

### **2. Urban Planners & Local Authorities (Coastal Cities and Towns)**
*Urban planners and local authorities in coastal cities and towns are essential users of the CoCliCo platform, as they are at the forefront of managing urban coastal resilience and adapting to climate change challenges at the local level. These users are responsible for decisions impacting the safety and sustainability of their communities and require tools and data that address their specific local contexts.*

**Primary Use:**

- Utilize the platform for city-specific coastal risk assessments, considering local capabilities and risks. The platform helps coastal cities access crucial information for developing climate adaptation strategies, enhancing resilience, and making informed, data-driven decisions.

**Example Case:**
> *"**Assessing Vulnerability**: A coastal city integrates the platform to assess its vulnerability to flooding and implements targeted solutions for its residents based on data-driven insights."*

> *"**Evaluating Erosion Trends**: A coastal city uses the platform to assess erosion trends along its shoreline. Insights help planners propose protective dune restoration, securing funding for a project that reduced flood risk for 5,000 residents."*

---

### **3. Infrastructure Owners & Managers**
*Private and public infrastructure owners, including those managing roads, ports, energy facilities, and other critical infrastructure along the coast, are key users of the CoCliCo platform. They are responsible for maintaining and operating essential assets and require robust tools to assess risks, plan for adaptation, and ensure the continuity of services against coastal hazards.*

**Primary Use:**

- Assess coastal hazards impacting infrastructure and identify measures to enhance resilience and reduce long-term risks. The platform can inform infrastructure investment and operational strategies to safeguard critical assets while ensuring service continuity.

**Example Case:**
> *"**Port Operators**: A port operator uses the platform to evaluate coastal erosion and flooding risks, ensuring the protection of critical infrastructure and uninterrupted operations."*

> *"**Infrastructure Agencies**: Smaller port authorities, local infrastructure agencies, and tourism services utilize the platform to access scientific support for maintaining resilient shorelines and mitigating flooding and erosion impacts on their operations."*

> *"**Municipalities and State Agencies**: Local and state agencies leverage the platform to proactively counter sea-level rise effects, securing the continuity of essential services. The platform provides resources, training, and guidance for climate adaptation planning"*

---

### **4. Researchers & Consultants (Coastal Hazards and Climate Impacts)**
*Engaged in scientific analysis and consulting, focusing on coastal hazard analysis, risk assessment, and climate adaptation solutions.*

**Primary Use:**

- Use the platform's advanced tools to conduct in-depth analyses of coastal hazards, sea-level rise, and erosion, providing vital data for research and consultation in coastal adaptation and policy development.

**Example Case:**
>  *"Researchers use the platform to analyze long-term erosion trends and its implications for coastal communities, contributing data for climate resilience studies."*
