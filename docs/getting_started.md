## **First steps**

Once you've accessed the CoCliCo platform, you'll be greeted with an interactive map and various tools to explore coastal climate data. This section will guide you through the key components of the interface, helping you navigate and use the platform effectively.

### **1. Main Interface Overview**

The main interface consists of the following elements:

- **Map Window** – The central area where you can visualize data layers and explore different locations.
- **Sidebar Menu** – Access to datasets and background layers. Click on the layers you want to activate.
- **Active Data Layers** – Adjust map settings, filters, and toggle visualization options.
- **Dashboard** - Save your analysis and scenarios in the Dashboard window for further analysis and comparison.
- **Interactive Pop-ups** – Click on specific locations to display detailed data insights.

### **2. Activate Data Layers**

To start your analysis, activate relevant data layers from the Sidebar Menu. These layers include sea level rise projections, coastal hazards, exposure, and adaptation strategies.

1. Open a category from the **Sidebar Menu**

### **3. Apply Filters**

The platform allows you to refine your analysis using filters such as return periods, climate scenarios, and hazard thresholds.

1. Click on the **Filters Panel**.
2. Choose a **Scenario** (e.g., low-end or high-end sea level rise).
3. Select a **Return Period** (e.g., 10-year, 100-year).
4. Apply the filters to update the map visualization.

### **4. Interact with data**

- **Pan and Zoom** – Navigate across the map using your mouse or touch gestures.
- **Click on a Location** – View detailed data insights through interactive pop-ups.
- **Compare Layers** – Activate multiple layers to analyze overlapping datasets.

### **5. Compare**

Users can save and compare results by exporting charts and datasets.

1. Click on a location to open the **insights Pop-up**.
2. Select **Add to Dashboard** to save it for later.
3. Compare different locations in the Dashboard window.

### **6. Accessing to raw data and examples**

Now that you're familiar with navigating the interface, continue to [Undestanding the Data](Datasets.md) for deeper insights into dataset usage or go to [Further Analysis](further_analysis.md) if you want to create you own experiments with the raw data (Examples included in this section).
