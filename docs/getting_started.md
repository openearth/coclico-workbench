The main interface consists of the following elements:

- **Map Window** – The central area where you can visualize data layers and explore different locations.
- **Sidebar Menu** – Access to datasets and background layers. Click on the layers you want to activate. 
- **Active Data Layers** – Adjust map settings, filters, and toggle visualization options.
- **Dashboard** - Save your analysis and scenarios in the Dashboard window for further analysis and comparison.
- **Interactive Pop-ups** – Click on specific locations to display detailed data insights.

### **3. Apply Filters**

The platform allows you to refine your analysis using filters such as return periods, climate scenarios, and hazard thresholds.

1. Go to the **Active Data Layers** window.
2. Choose a **Scenario** (e.g., low-end or high-end sea level rise).
3. Select a **Return Period** (e.g., 10-year, 100-year).
4. The Filters are applied automatically, so go to your **Map Window** and check the changes in the **Data Layer**.
